This is because we want to explitictly tell our model that padding tokens are irrelevant to determining the sentiment of a sentence.

Also, note that the LSTM returns the `output` and a tuple of the final `hidden` state and the final `cell` state, whereas the standard RNN only returned the `output` and final `hidden` state. \n","\n","As the final hidden state of our LSTM has both a forward and a backward component, which will be concatenated together, the size of the input to the `nn.Linear` layer is twice that of the hidden dimension size.\n","\n","Implementing bidirectionality and adding additional layers are done by passing values for the `num_layers` and `bidirectional` arguments for the RNN/LSTM. \n","\n","The LSTM has a `dropout` argument which adds dropout on the connections between hidden states in one layer to hidden states in the next layer.\n","\n","As we are passing the lengths of our sentences to be able to use packed padded sequences, we have to add a second argument, `text_lengths`, to `forward`. \n","\n","Before we pass our embeddings to the LSTM, we need to pack them, which we do with `nn.utils.rnn.packed_padded_sequence`. This will cause our LSTM to only process the non-padded elements of our sequence. The LSTM will then return `packed_output` (a packed sequence) as well as the `hidden` and `cell` states (both of which are tensors). Without packed padded sequences, `hidden` and `cell` are tensors from the last element in the sequence, which will most probably be a pad token, however when using packed padded sequences they are both from the last non-padded element in the sequence.\n","\n","We then unpack the output sequence, with `nn.utils.rnn.pad_packed_sequence`, to transform it from a packed sequence to a tensor. The elements of `output` from padding tokens will be zero tensors (tensors where every element is zero). Usually, we only have to unpack output if we are going to use it later on in the model. Although we aren't in this case, we still unpack the sequence just to show how it is done.\n","\n","The final hidden state, `hidden`, has a shape of _[num layers $\\times$ num directions, batch size, hid dim]_.
